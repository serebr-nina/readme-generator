# README Generator

## Description
The README Generator app speeds up the process of writing a README file. It is built using Node.js. One of the possible ways to improve the app in the future is to make filling out some of the README sections optional.

## Installation
To begin using the app, clone this repo. Next, run an "npm install" command in your command line interface to install necessary dependancies.

## Usage
Run a "node index" command to start the app's questions prompts that relate to various sections of the README. The file gets generated using provided answers.
